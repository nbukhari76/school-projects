# school-projects
These are the various coding projects I have created during my time at UCLA

hw2_2.cpp: Prints the month that corresponds to the inputted numerical value that was inputted


hw2_3.cpp: Calculates the quadratic formula from the inputted values



hw3_1.cpp: Takes four random values and orders them




hw3_2.cpp: Converts positive integers into binary numbers



hw3_3.cpp: Determines which value of the two inputted values are the minimum and which are the maximum




hw3_4.cpp: Prints as many Fibonacci sequence values as the numerical value of the input
